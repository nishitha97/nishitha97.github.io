                        applications. The application’s primary purpose was to analyze code complexity of program
                        statements
                        based on four main criteria namely size, inheritance, nesting levels and recursion. Java along
                        with
                        a
                        specially developed ANTLR parser was used for complexity identification purposes and JavaFX was
                        used
                        to
                        develop the user interfaces. Here all the code complexities identified relevant to a particular
                        complexity criterion, are given a pre-defined score, and displayed to the user such that the

                        can
                        get an idea and understanding on complexity of a particular code file or program statement.

                        add,
                        update or delete journey routes, route inspectors as well as time table information were also
                        implemented in the development of this system.
                        A key point to note in the development process of this system is that this system was developed
                        based on
                        design document handed down to the group members and that all user interfaces, features and
